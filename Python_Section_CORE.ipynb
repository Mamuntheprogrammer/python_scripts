        "Python is an **interpreted**, **high-level** ,**general-purpose** programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.\n",

        "Python is **dynamically-typed** and **garbage-collected**. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a **\"batteries included\"** language due to its comprehensive standard library.\n",

        "Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x and later are supported.\n",
